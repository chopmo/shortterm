** Keep selected story index on epic page when returning from story

** Copy story Shortcut URL to clipboard
Because I need it in the git commits.

** Always show state headings (eg. "Unscheduled") even if the list is empty
So we can see the applied filtering.

** Allow moving stories between states?

** Show comments on story
